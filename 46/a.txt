Knowing how often a word appears in a sentence or block
of text is helpful for creating word clouds and other types
of word analysis. And it’s more useful when running it
against lots of text.
Create a program that reads in a file and counts the frequen-
cy of words in the file. Then construct a histogram displaying
the words and the frequency, and display the histogram to
the screen.
Example Output
Given the text file words.txt with this content
badger badger badger badger mushroom mushroom
snake badger badger badger
the program would produce the following output:
badger:
mushroom:
snake:
Constraint
Ensure that the most used word is at the top of the report
and the least used words are at the bottom.
Challenges
Use a graphical program and generate bar graphs.
Test the performance of your calculation by providing 1
a very large input file, such as Shakespeare’s Macbeth.
Tweak your algorithm so that it performs the word
counting as fast as possible.
Write the program in another language and compare
the processing times of the two implementations.
